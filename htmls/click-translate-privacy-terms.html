    <h1>Click Translate Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated-at">Last Updated: October 29, 2025</p>
    <p class="small">
      This Privacy Policy explains how information is processed when you use the Click Translate browser extension (the “Extension”). Please read this Policy carefully and make sure you understand it. If you do not agree with any part of this Policy, you should uninstall and stop using the Extension.
    </p>
    <p class="small">
      In particular, please note: the Extension primarily operates as a client-side tool and relies on third-party services (for example, translation APIs or language model providers) to perform translation. How those third-party services handle your data is governed by their own policies, which we strongly encourage you to review.
    </p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section class="section">
      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>The Extension is designed to follow a principle of data minimization and only processes information necessary to provide its functionality. Depending on which features and settings you use, the following types of information may be involved:</p>

      <h3>1.1 Device and Browser Information (typically not actively collected)</h3>
      <p>
        The Extension runs locally in your browser and, by default, does not actively send device identifiers, browser fingerprints, or similar information directly to the developer.
        However, in some situations, such information may be collected or inferred by third-party services (for example, for anti-abuse, logging, or billing purposes), including when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>you use translation features that invoke third-party APIs;</li>
        <li>you register or sign in to accounts with third-party providers;</li>
        <li>you have already granted certain permissions to those third-party services at the browser or system level.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.2 Text and Context for Translation</h3>
      <p>
        When you select text and invoke translation through the Extension, the selected content and necessary contextual information (for example, source language, target language, and possibly surrounding sentences) are sent to the translation service provider you have configured,
        so that a translation result can be generated. This content may include sensitive information, so you should avoid submitting any text you do not wish to be processed by third-party providers.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3 Local Settings and Preferences</h3>
      <p>To provide a better user experience, the Extension may store certain settings in your browser’s local storage or sync storage, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>interface language and default target language;</li>
        <li>which translation service provider you use and whether its API key or credentials have been configured;</li>
        <li>personalized interface options, such as whether to show floating buttons or which keyboard shortcuts are enabled.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information is typically stored only on your browser (including sync storage provided by the browser vendor) and is not proactively uploaded to the developer’s servers.
        If you use the browser’s synchronization features, these settings may be synchronized across your devices, and that process is managed by your browser provider.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We use information processed through the Extension primarily for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>to provide and improve the core functionality of the Extension (such as translation and interface behavior);</li>
        <li>to connect you to and invoke the translation service providers you have selected or configured;</li>
        <li>to remember your preferences locally so you do not need to reconfigure settings every time you use the Extension.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If, in the future, we need to process additional information to improve stability, security, or features, we will provide reasonable notice in relevant locations and will, wherever feasible, use measures such as aggregation or de-identification to reduce privacy risks.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>3. Sharing of Information and Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>The Extension itself does not sell your personal information to third parties for commercial purposes.</p>
      <p>However, in order to perform translation and related features, the Extension will send necessary data to the third-party service providers you choose or configure, including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the text you select for translation and related context;</li>
        <li>language settings such as source and target languages;</li>
        <li>identifiers for the services you configure locally (such as model names or endpoint URLs).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Examples of such third-party services include translation API providers and language model providers, as described in the Extension’s documentation and settings pages.
        Your relationship with those third parties, and how they process your data, are governed by the terms of service and privacy policies you accept with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that if you upload, store, or process sensitive information (such as personal identifiers, financial data, or health information) using third-party services, you are responsible for evaluating the associated risks and ensuring that those providers meet your security and compliance requirements.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>
        4.1 Local storage: Most data related to the Extension’s configuration (such as language settings, interface options, and certain toggle states) is stored in your browser’s local or sync storage.
        You can reset or clear this data through your browser’s extension management page or the Extension’s own settings page.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.2 Server-side storage: If a backend service is used together with the Extension (for example, to provide anonymous usage statistics, anti-abuse mechanisms, or unified proxying of requests),
        that backend may log limited technical information (such as timestamps, partial IP data, or response status codes) to help ensure stability and security. Details depend on the specific backend deployment and documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.3 Security measures: We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to help protect information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
        However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and you should remain cautious when processing sensitive information.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
      <p>When using the Extension, you generally have the following controls:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you may disable or uninstall the Extension at any time in your browser to stop it from running;</li>
        <li>you may clear or reset local configuration data through the Extension’s settings page (for example, using a “Clear All Settings” feature);</li>
        <li>you may freely choose, change, or disable the translation service providers you configure;</li>
        <li>you may choose not to submit text or content that you consider sensitive or do not want processed by third parties.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If applicable data protection laws (for example, in certain jurisdictions) grant you additional rights (such as rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, or objection),
        you may exercise those rights directly with the relevant third-party service providers for data they control. For any limited data controlled directly by the Extension’s developer, you may contact the developer through the project repository,
        and we will respond within a reasonable scope, taking into account technical feasibility and legal obligations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>6. Children and Minors</h2>
      <p>
        The Extension is intended for users with full legal capacity. If you are a minor under the laws of your jurisdiction, you should only use the Extension under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian,
        and you should obtain their consent before submitting any information. If we become aware that information from a minor has been processed without appropriate consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete or anonymize such information where feasible.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>7. Cross-Border Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Because some third-party services used by the Extension may host their servers in other countries or regions, text and technical information you submit for translation may be transferred to and processed in those locations.
        Such cross-border transfers are typically conducted directly by the third-party service providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where applicable laws impose specific requirements on cross-border data transfers (for example, separate consent, security assessments, or standard contractual clauses), you should assess those requirements and ensure that they are satisfied before choosing and using such third-party services.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example to reflect changes in features, legal requirements, or security practices.
        When this Policy is materially changed, we will provide notice in reasonable locations (such as the project repository, release notes, or links from the Extension’s settings page) and update the “Last Updated” date above.
      </p>
      <p>
        By continuing to use the Extension after an updated Policy becomes effective, you acknowledge that you have read and understood the updated Policy. If you do not agree with the updated Policy, you should uninstall and stop using the Extension.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>9. Contact</h2>
      <p>
        If you have any questions, comments, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or privacy matters related to the Extension, you can contact the developer via the project repository (for example, by opening an issue on GitHub).
        Please avoid sharing excessive sensitive personal information in public channels to reduce unnecessary privacy risks.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        (Notice: This Privacy Policy is a general example tailored for the Click Translate Extension and does not constitute legal advice.
        If you plan to use the Extension in highly regulated or sensitive contexts, you should consult a qualified attorney and create a customized privacy policy based on your specific circumstances.)

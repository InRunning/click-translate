    <h1>Click Translate Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated-at">Last Updated: October 29, 2025</p>
    <p class="small">
      Thank you for using the Click Translate browser extension (the “Extension”). These Terms of Service (these “Terms”) are a legal agreement between you and the developer of the Extension governing your use of the Extension and any related services.
    </p>
    <p class="small">
      Please read these Terms carefully before installing or using the Extension. By installing, enabling, or using the Extension, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.
      If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must uninstall and stop using the Extension immediately.
    </p>
    <p class="small">
      These Terms are intended for individual end users and do not apply to any separate written agreement for commercial or enterprise use. If you wish to use the Extension in an enterprise, bulk deployment, or integration setting, please contact the developer to enter into a separate agreement.
    </p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>1.1 You must be a natural person with the full legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement under the laws of your place of residence in order to use the Extension. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you may only use the Extension under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who has read and agreed to these Terms on your behalf.</p>
      <p>1.2 If you are using the Extension on behalf of a company, organization, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, in which case “you” and “user” will refer to that entity.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>2. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>2.1 The developer may update or modify these Terms from time to time, for example to reflect changes in features, applicable laws, or operational requirements. When changes are made, the developer will take reasonable steps to provide notice, such as updating the repository README, release notes, or links from the Extension’s settings page, and revising the “Last Updated” date above.</p>
      <p>2.2 By continuing to install or use the Extension after the updated Terms become effective, you agree to be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using and uninstall the Extension.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>3. Services and License</h2>
      <h3>3.1 Description of the Services</h3>
      <p>
        The Extension primarily provides translation-related functionality for web content (the exact features may evolve over time), including but not limited to: selected-text translation, paragraph translation, and translation with contextual hints.
        The Extension does not guarantee that any specific content can be successfully translated, nor does it guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or suitability of any translation result for a particular purpose.
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 License Grant</h3>
      <p>
        Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, the developer grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to install and use the Extension for your personal, non-commercial use in supported browsers.
      </p>
      <p>You may not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Extension, except to the extent permitted by applicable law;</li>
        <li>modify, repackage, sell, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise use the Extension or any part of it for commercial purposes, unless expressly authorized in writing by the developer;</li>
        <li>remove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices displayed in or with the Extension;</li>
        <li>use the Extension in any way that could interfere with its normal operation or the normal use of the Extension by others.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>4. Your Accounts and Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        4.1 The Extension itself does not provide a standalone translation service. Instead, it may integrate with third-party interfaces or services (for example, translation APIs), as described in the Extension’s settings or documentation.
        Certain features may require you to register an account with a third-party provider, obtain API keys, or grant other forms of authorization.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.2 Your use of any third-party services is governed by the terms and privacy policies of those third parties. You are solely responsible for reviewing and complying with those terms, including any usage limits, fees, and data processing practices.
        The Extension and its developer make no warranties regarding the availability, security, compliance, or performance of third-party services.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.3 You are responsible for safeguarding any credentials, API keys, or tokens associated with third-party services and must not disclose them to unauthorized parties. Any requests, charges, or disputes arising from your use of third-party services via your credentials are solely your responsibility.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>5. Acceptable Use and Your Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>When using the Extension and any related services, you agree that you will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>comply with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as the rules of any platform or website you access (including browser extension store policies and site terms of use);</li>
        <li>not use the Extension for any unlawful, infringing, or harmful purposes, including but not limited to violating others’ privacy, intellectual property, or other legal rights;</li>
        <li>not use the Extension to collect, store, or process sensitive personal data beyond what is reasonably necessary, unless you have obtained all necessary permissions and are in full compliance with applicable laws;</li>
        <li>not abuse APIs or other service interfaces via the Extension, for example by sending abnormally high volumes of automated requests or attempting to bypass access controls or billing mechanisms;</li>
        <li>not intentionally upload or distribute malware, viruses, worms, or other harmful code through or in connection with the Extension.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you violate any of the above obligations, the developer may take reasonable technical or legal measures, including without limitation restricting your ability to use the Extension, describing the risk in the public repository, or reporting relevant information to competent authorities where required by law.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        6.1 The Extension, including its documentation, user interface, and source code (except where otherwise noted as open source), is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights owned by the developer or applicable rightsholders.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.2 If portions of the Extension are released under an open-source license, your use of those portions is also governed by the applicable open-source license. The specific license terms and scope will be described in the project repository or accompanying documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.3 These Terms do not grant you any rights to use the trademarks, trade names, logos, or branding associated with the Extension or the developer, except as necessary to truthfully refer to the Extension or as expressly authorized in writing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>7. Fees and Changes</h2>
      <p>
        7.1 The Extension is currently made available free of charge for individual users. However, some of the third-party services that the Extension can connect to (such as specific translation APIs) may charge fees.
        Any such fees are determined by those third parties and are settled directly between you and the third-party provider. The Extension and its developer do not collect or process payments on behalf of those third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        7.2 If, in the future, the Extension itself introduces paid features or subscription plans, the developer will clearly describe the pricing, payment methods, and applicable terms in the relevant user interface or documentation.
        If you do not agree with such fees or terms, you may simply choose not to use the paid features.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>8. Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        8.1 The Extension is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no guarantee that the Extension or related services will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free;</li>
        <li>There is no guarantee that any translation results will be accurate, complete, or suitable for any particular purpose or context;</li>
        <li>There is no guarantee regarding the availability, quality, or performance of third-party services that the Extension may connect to.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        8.2 To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the developer will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages (including, without limitation, lost profits, loss of data, or business interruption) arising out of or in connection with your use of or inability to use the Extension, even if the developer has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        8.3 You understand that the Extension is intended as an assistive tool only. You remain solely responsible for reviewing and verifying any translations or outputs, especially when they are used for legal, financial, compliance, medical, or other high-risk decisions, and you should seek professional advice where appropriate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the total aggregate liability of the developer to you for any claims arising out of or relating to the Extension or these Terms will be limited to the amount you have actually paid to the developer (if any) for use of the Extension.
        If the Extension is provided free of charge, the developer will have no monetary liability to you.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>10. Termination and Discontinuation</h2>
      <p>10.1 You may stop using the Extension at any time and may uninstall it through your browser’s extension management interface. Uninstalling the Extension terminates your ongoing use under these Terms but does not affect provisions that by their nature should survive termination.</p>
      <p>10.2 If you materially breach these Terms or violate applicable laws when using the Extension, the developer may take reasonable measures, including without limitation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>describing the relevant risks or misuse in the public repository or project homepage;</li>
        <li>releasing updated versions that restrict or mitigate certain abusive patterns of use;</li>
        <li>providing relevant information to competent authorities where required or permitted by law.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>10.3 Provisions that by their nature should survive termination (including, without limitation, those relating to intellectual property, disclaimers, and limitations of liability) will remain in effect after you stop using the Extension.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        11.1 Unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of applicable law, these Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them or the Extension are governed by the laws of the People’s Republic of China (excluding its conflict-of-law rules).
      </p>
      <p>
        11.2 Any disputes arising from or relating to these Terms or your use of the Extension should first be resolved through good-faith negotiations. If the parties are unable to resolve a dispute through negotiation, you agree that the dispute may be submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction in the location of the developer.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>12. Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p>
        12.1 If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court or other authority of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        12.2 You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under these Terms without the prior written consent of the developer. The developer may assign or transfer these Terms (in whole or in part) to an affiliate or successor in interest where reasonably necessary for operation of the Extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        12.3 If you have any questions or suggestions about these Terms, you may contact the developer via the contact methods provided in the project repository (for example, by opening an issue on GitHub).
